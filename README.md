# The Official Animalia Wiki
Pretty cool piece of tech made by RickyTheRacc to hold information about the Animalia
world! The site is hosted on pages, and uses a workflow to construct the entire site off
of markdown files found in the md directory :>

# Building Site 
Run the following commands in order from the root directory:
- npm install
- npx tsc
- node generate.js
