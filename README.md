# The Official Animalia Wiki
Pretty cool piece of tech made by RickyTheRacc to hold information about the Animalia
world! The site is hosted on pages, and uses a workflow to construct the entire site off
of markdown files found in the md directory! 

Developers, if you want to fiddle with the actual html/css/js of the site, it's generally
easier to just run generate-wiki.js and then fiddle with the resulting pages than it is
to tweak stuff in the template, you'll have an easier time seeing how your changes affect
the text of the markdown!
