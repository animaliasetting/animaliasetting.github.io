# Mythos
A far off god split itself into fragments to explore the universe. One fragment 
crash-landed on the planet, and was dying. She was unable to save herself, but lying 
there, dying, she witnessed the beauty of the natural life in the world. She cried, 
overcome by the beauty of it. And the creatures that drank of her tears became more 
like her. Rising up on two legs, becoming sapient.

As she died, decomposed...her body became part of the world. Her blood and breath 
are the force of magic in the world. Her bones became mountains, etc.
