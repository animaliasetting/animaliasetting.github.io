# Animalia
## A free-to-use setting by LustyLamb/LambSprout

A world forever changed by arcane warfare. The majority of the world rendered 
uninhabitable by humanoids. Animals made sapient by arcane influence. The remaining 
pockets of folk struggle to find stability in a world inundated by the chaos of Magic.

Anyone is welcome to make characters in this setting, so long as no profit is gained 
from my ideas. Thank you :)

## Overview
The world of Animalia takes place on an Earth-like planet, the rules of physics and 
such are the same, except for one major difference. Magic exists. It's a natural force 
that shapes the world to its whims. It resides in Leylines beneath the world's surface, 
as well as within all living things. Its natural currents shape the seasons and weather 
patterns around the world.

The world is inhabited by beastfolk, animal-like Humanoids who thrive by harnessing the 
magic of the world to expand their societies. One hundred years ago there was a great 
war of spellcasters, the majority of the world was rendered uninhabitable by powerful 
Arcane Bombs. These bombs, concentrated magic tapped directly from the leylines, 
inundated the world with magic to a degree never before known. Things would never be 
the same.

Only a handful of Humanoid societies survived, isolated City-States protected by arcane 
shielding. Outside, in the wilds- life went on. Animal-kind, more in tune with magic 
found themselves changed. Slowly, it became apparent that a proportion of Animal-kind 
had been Awakened- or, uplifted. They had gained sentience, and those that were 
accustomed to contact with Humanoids slowly began to be integrated into society.
